            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Taco night at home is a frequent occurrence and so Mexican rice is a side dish we often have. Back in the day I used to buy the microwavable Spanish rice packets for convenience -- and because I didn't have a good homemade recipe yet.  Now I make this perfect fluffy rice all of the time.  My easy Mexican rice recipe doesn't include any extra fillings, so your picky kids will also love it!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil</li>
                <li>1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups chicken stock or broth</li>
                <li>8 oz can tomato sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the rice in a mesh strainer until water draining is clear. (This is optional, but it helps remove the starch and keep the cooked rice from being mushy.)</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the rice and cook until translucent (somewhat clear) about 3-4 minutes; stirring frequently.</li>
                <li>Add the rest of the ingredients and bring to a rapid boil over high heat.</li>
                <li>Stir once and cover. Turn the heat down to almost low (a little less than medium low) and cook for 25 minutes.  Remove cover and let stand 2-3 minutes before fluffing with a fork.</li>
            </ol>
